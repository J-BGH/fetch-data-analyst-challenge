# Fetch Data Analysis Summary

Hi Team,

I've completed the analysis of our retail receipt data and wanted to share key insights that could help inform our business strategy. Here are the most significant findings from this investigation:

## Key Data Quality Issues

1. **Missing Values**: Our data has several important gaps:
   - 3.7% of users have missing birth dates
   - 11.5% of transactions have missing barcodes
   - 26.8% of products have missing brand information

2. **Data Consistency Issues**:
   - 94 transactions (0.2%) show negative scan delays where the scan date is before the purchase date
   - The FINAL_QUANTITY field contains mixed formats (numeric values and text like "zero")
   - We found 171 duplicate transactions which were removed for analysis

## Business Insights

### Top Brands Analysis

1. **Top 5 Brands Among Users 21+**:
   - DOVE: 14 receipts
   - UNKNOWN: 14 receipts
   - NERDS CANDY: 14 receipts
   - COCA-COLA: 13 receipts
   - SOUR PATCH KIDS: 13 receipts

2. **Top 5 Brands by Sales (6+ Month Account Holders)**:

   - ANNIE'S HOMEGROWN GROCERY: $2,609.04
   - DOVE: $2,562.42
   - BAREFOOT: $2,500.33
   - ORIBE: $2,282.91

3. **Health & Wellness Category**:
   - Makes up 57.89% of our total sales volume
   - This significant percentage suggests we should focus more resources on this category

### User Behavior Insights

1. **Power User Profile**:
   - 305 power users represent 1.72% of our user base
   - Average of 3.7 receipts per power user
   - Average spend: $58.03 per power user
   - Shop at 2.2 different retailers on average
   - NY has the highest concentration of power users

2. **Dips & Salsa Category Leadership**:
   - UNKNOWN brand holds 31.3% market share
   - TOSTITOS (5.2%) and FRITOS (4.1%) follow as distant second and third
   - Total category generates over $27K in sales

3. **Growth Trends**:
   - Data shows only transactions from 2024, limiting year-over-year analysis
   - Monthly user growth between June and July 2024 was 60.8%
   - However, we saw a significant decline in August and September
   - This seasonal pattern requires further investigation

## Data-Driven Recommendations

1. **Brand Partnerships**: Explore stronger partnerships with DOVE and UNKNOWN brands, which perform well across multiple metrics.

2. **Health & Wellness Focus**: With nearly 58% of sales in this category, we should:
   - Expand our Health & Wellness offerings and promotions
   - Create targeted campaigns for this category's high-value customers

3. **Data Quality Improvements**:
   - Implement better barcode recognition to reduce missing product data
   - Standardize the FINAL_QUANTITY field to numeric values only
   - Develop automated checks for receipt dates to flag potential errors

4. **User Retention Strategy**: Create specialized campaigns for our power users, particularly in NY where we have the highest concentration.

I've prepared detailed visualizations showing these trends and would be happy to walk through the findings in our next strategy meeting.

Best regards,
